<h3 style="color:grey"> Our future vision is based on the idea of "Smart Skies".

We are willing to make journeys shorter so we can save time, energy and expenses. we want to produce effective plane that can hold 1000 passengers with a faster speed and more power efficieny. we are also trying hard to increase the safety in our airplanes. our experts are trying to design a new amazing and highly protective technique. The "cabin" passengers will emerge from its place in the plane by the aid of supporting balloons dedicated to bear the weight of the passenger cabin and get off it securely on land or on water balloons. The"cabin" will also be equipped with airbags in case of water landing so it stays on the surface of the sea without drowning or endangering the safety of passengers at risk.</h3>
